This repository contains performance measurement results collected using the Linux perf stat tool as part of my bachelor's thesis.
In this project, I used perf stat to monitor important events during benchmark runs, and the output is stored as .txt files.
Each branch corresponds to a different kernel configuration. Browse the branches to view the result files for each configuration.

Note: The results are recorded in text files following the standard output format of the perf stat command. The command separations for larger numbers are generated by the Linux perf tool. 

Any modifications made to facilitate the launching and stopping of perf are available in my forked version of the original repository, which can be found on my GitHub account as well.
