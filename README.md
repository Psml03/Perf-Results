This repository contains performance measurement results collected using the Linux perf stat tool as part of my bachelor's thesis.
In this project, I used perf stat to monitor important events during benchmark runs, and the output is stored as .txt files.
Each branch corresponds to a different kernel configuration. Browse the branches to view the result files for each configuration. Any modifications made to facilitate the launching and stopping of perf are available in my forked version of the original repository, which can be found on my GitHub account as well.

Note: The results are recorded in text files following the standard output format of the perf stat command. The command separations for larger numbers are generated by the Linux perf tool.  

Scripts:
- The run_and_commit.perf script automates running the LEBench benchmark along with perf profiling for multiple runs, the results are uploaded to GitHub. Manual adjustments are required for file paths, directory locations, and repository branches.

-The computeStatsPerf script processes the data .txt files and extracts values such as IPC and Branch-miss Rate. It then computes average, median, and standard deviation and saves the results to an Excel file. 
-The computeDegradationPerf script takes two Excel files as inputs and calculates performance degradation as a percentage. It compares the "average" values from both files, determining how much performance has changed, and saves the results in an Excel file. The two input Excel files should be created using computeStatsPerf.
