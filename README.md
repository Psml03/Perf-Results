This repository contains performance measurement results collected using the Linux perf stat tool as part of my bachelor's thesis.
In this project, I used perf stat to monitor important events during benchmark runs, and the output is stored as .txt files.

Output Files:
The results are recorded in text files following the standard output format of the perf stat command. Below is an example of a typical output:
Performance counter stats for process id '206280':

Note: The command separation and formatting are generated by the Linux perf tool, and the numbers represent standard measurements from the tool. 

Any modifications made to facilitate the launching and stopping of perf are available in my forked version of the original repository, which can be found on my GitHub account as well.
